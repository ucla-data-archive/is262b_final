## Data & File Overview

Excerpt from the Gapminder data for the purpose of instruction and demonstrating computational reproducibility in Dataverse. This data is an excerpt of data found in specific spreadsheets on [Gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org/) circa 2010. It is not a definitive source of socioeconomic data will not be updated. Use other data sources if it’s important to have the current best estimate of these statistics.

The gapminder data include six variables, ([Gapminder.org documentation page](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/)):

| variable | meaning |
|:---------|:--------|
| country  |         | 
| continent	|        |
| year	   |         |
| lifeExp  | life expectancy at birth |
| pop      | total population  | 
| gdpPercap | per-capita GDP |

Per-capita GDP (Gross domestic product) is given in units of international dollars, “a hypothetical unit of currency that has the same purchasing power parity that the U.S. dollar had in the United States at a given point in time” – 2005, in this case.

## Geographic location of data collection
